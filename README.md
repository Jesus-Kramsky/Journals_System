**How to run project locally**
1. Install SQL Server Management Studio and last version of SQL Server Express.
2. Type the next command in CMD "sqllocaldb create journalsDatabase" to create the Server in SQL Server Management Studio so the connection string located in Program.cs works correctly.
3. To see the server in SQL SMS select "Connect" and type "(localdb)\JournalsDatabase" with windows authentication.
4. Git clone the project in your device.
5. Open VS and type "Update-database" in package management console.
